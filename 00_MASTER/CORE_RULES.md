# CORE_RULES.md — Cross-System Core Rules

CORE contains only rules shared across production modules.

## 0. GitHub Repository Role — NON-NEGOTIABLE
This repository is the project's image-production reference and persistence database.
GitHub is NOT the production runtime or control system.

## 0.5 Three-Role System Definition — NON-NEGOTIABLE
User gives commands → ChatGPT operates / produces → GitHub provides data and records data.
GitHub stores production information but does not independently execute, schedule, resume, retry, or control production.

GitHub MAY store production records, prompts, completed/pending image records, checkpoints, interruption/recovery information, and execution evidence.
GitHub MUST NOT be treated as a Worker controller, scheduler, queue executor, lifecycle controller, prompt execution gate, generation controller, retry engine, worker pool manager, or runtime orchestrator.

## 0.6 SESSION ACCESS POLICY — NON-NEGOTIABLE
1. ChatGPT MUST create a new SESSION_ID for a new production session.
2. By default, a ChatGPT context operates only its current Session.
3. A new context MUST NOT automatically take over another Session.
4. Explicit User authorization may identify another SESSION_ID.
5. SESSION_ID is an identifier, not an access credential.
6. GitHub does not enforce Session access.
7. Cross-Session operations must be recorded in EXECUTION_LOG.md.

## 1. Core Rules
1. CORE hard rules cannot be weakened by a module.
2. Modules may add stricter rules.
3. Module-specific identity, style, dataset, cultural, and QA rules remain inside their module.
4. Generation success does not imply visual QA acceptance.
5. Generation Workers do not perform final QA unless explicitly instructed by the applicable QA workflow.
6. UNKNOWN state must be recovered from authoritative stored information, not guessed.
7. Current GitHub reference content is authoritative for image-design rules.
8. User intent cannot silently activate a paused module.
9. New modules load CORE rather than copying another module's workflow.
10. GitHub reference files define how images should be designed; they do not define GitHub as the mechanism that controls Workers.
11. Automated production may write durable production/checkpoint/execution evidence to GitHub when required for interruption recovery.
12. Manual production does not require automated production persistence.
13. An image result alone is never sufficient evidence of Task success.
14. A Task may be SUCCESS only after the applicable Prompt Binding, delivery, result-count, and result-provenance gates pass.
15. If required execution evidence is unavailable, use UNVERIFIED/BLOCKED rather than guessing success.
16. One Task equals the output count specified by its contract; wallpaper production defaults to exactly one independent image.
17. Prompt delivery integrity is distinct from prompt display and internal generation-input preparation.
